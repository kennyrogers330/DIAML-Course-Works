# DIAML-Course-Works

Welcome to my DIAML (Data Inference and Applied Machine Learning) course work repository! These assignments cover a wide range of topics including data cleaning, statistical analysis, prediction, seasonality and trends detection, model training, and model accuracy assessment.

## Repository Description

- The `.ipynb` Python files follow the naming convention `mkennyro_DIAML_Assignment_n` and contain Jupyter Notebooks with the codes for each assignment.
- The PDF files adhere to the naming format `mkennyro_DIAML_Assignment_n` and serve as documentation. They define the problem at hand, present the solution, results, insights, inferences, and include citations.

Feel free to explore the assignments, delve into the code, and learn more about the insights provided in the documentation files.
